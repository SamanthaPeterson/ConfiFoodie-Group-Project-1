## Objective

ConfiFoodie is designed to take the stress away from deciding what to make for the users next meal using real-time weather data and pairing it with correlating comfort-inspired recipes. Our goal is to provide a worry-free way to chill and recharge while also introducing users to new or forgotten comfort meal favorites.

## Usage

Users will first enter location details on the UI that utilizes Bulma and Modals, and then will be provided their weather related comfort food recipe via Javascript that utilizes both a weather and recipe API.
